# ðŸ©º Pneumonia X-Ray Detection using Keras
Dataset: Kaggle - Pneumonia X-ray Images

This project demonstrates how TensorFlow and Keras can be applied to real-world medical image classification tasks â€” specifically detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays.
Iâ€™ve included step-by-step explanations of the model architecture and the libraries used (see Steps_to_be_considered.txt for details).
